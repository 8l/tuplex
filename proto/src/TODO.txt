Dataspace syntax support

Generic type instance fields support
 - To support declaring instance fields of parameterized type by reference
 - Requires creating 'concrete' member entity copies in specialized subtype

Initializers / constructors

Type conversions (with if statements)

Interfaces

Range typeclass

for-loops

Tuple literals
Array literals

Destructors

Union typeclass

Full dataspaces support

Shared objects

Make TxType be fully defined upon construction (during type resolution pass)
 - Means base types are fully resolved by subtype construction
 - Static (vtable) and instance field layouts can be done upon construction
 - Target (LLVM) type construction could also be done right away

Dynamic generics support
 - To support declaring instance fields of dynamically resolved type by value (not just reference)
 - Requires making the AST for a generic type definition re-entrant, and reprocessed for each specialization

Enum typeclass
