Bool type

Arithmetic operations

Inheritance: Static fields, V-table, and polymorphism 

Interfaces

Make TxType be fully defined upon construction (during type resolution pass)
 - Means base types are fully resolved by subtype construction
 - Static (vtable) and instance field layouts can be done upon construction
 - Target (LLVM) type construction could also be done right away

Heap allocation

Dynamic generics support
 - To support declaring instance fields of dynamically resolved type by value (not just reference)
 - Requires making the AST for a generic type definition re-entrant, and reprocessed for each specialization
